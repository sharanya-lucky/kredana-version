        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
          If a customer requests cancellation after payment, refund requests
          must be submitted within the eligible period. Approved refunds will be
          processed within 48 hours of confirmation and credited through the
          original payment method, subject to payment gateway timelines. Refunds
          may not be applicable once subscription benefits have been extensively
          utilized or in cases of policy misuse.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-justify mb-6">
          Subscribers may cancel renewal at any time through their account
          settings or by contacting support. Cancellation prevents future
          billing but does not retroactively refund completed billing cycles
          unless covered under the refund terms.
